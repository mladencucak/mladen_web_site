Briefly, the focus of my work is on understanding and quantifying the relationship between the pest, host, environment and human interaction in diverse agronomic pathosystems, in order to turn it into a practical integrated pest management decision making advice. 
I am combining statistical and mathematical computational approaches [(*example*)](https://mladencucak.github.io/PLBFieldTrial/index.html) with applied field/lab methods [(*example*)](https://mladencucak.github.io/AnalysisPLBIreland/) to simplify and understand these relationships. I believe that science should be accessible and reproducible, hence all computational work from my PhD is freely available, open-source and reproducible.  
My formal education background is in the field of plant production/plant protection, which later evolved due to the interest in the quantitative side of plant protection. I became interested in integrated pest management in agriculture during my Master studies, after which I got an opportunity to work on a project devoted to the development of crop disease and pest decision support system [VIPS](http://testvips.nibio.no/) in Norwegian Institute of Bio-Economy Research (NIBIO). Subsequently, that path led me to start my PhD study on forecasting potato late blight in the Republic of Ireland. On my professional and educational path, I have lived and worked in diverse teams and conditions in four countries other than my own.Â
