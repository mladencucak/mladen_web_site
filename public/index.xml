      <description>I had the privilege to attend, as a newcomer, the 12nd ed. of the International Epidemiology Workshop (IEW) in Lillihammer, Norway, during early June 2018. We were in a relatively small group of 50 plant epidemiologists from several countries around the world that interacted in several ways during three days of presentations of talks and posters and time for discussion.

      <description>I am plant pathologist specialized in epidemiology and management of plant diseases (CV). I lead a research Lab where two major kinds of work are conducted. One that is focused on computational approaches (simulation and statistical models) and another that is based on observational or experimental research associated with bench work (wet lab). The computational work is non pathogen-specific and covers a broader range of topics in plant disease epidemiology, including:</description>

This led me to co-found Open Plant Pathology Initiative. In my Lab, we make use of R language and Tidyverse for all statistical and data science related activities.</description>

More recently I have given a few webinars. The slides of the most of my recent talks are available for visualization or download at SpeakerDeck (SD).</description>

I try to incorporate advanced statistical and mathematical comutational approaches to simplify and understand these relationships.</description>
